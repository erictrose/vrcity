## Project Summary
An automatically generating vr city. It starts with a single building, and adds buildings as new accounts are created. <br>

## Known Issues
I know, it takes a really long time to load. It has to do with the loading of building assets. The ideal solution would be to generate all the buildings into one model file, then serve that file. Need to look into .obj file generation.
